## Distribution Robust SSL

- [Distributionally Robust Semi-Supervised Learning for People-Centric Sensing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05299.pdf) (AAAI 2019) - Authors: Kaixuan Chen, Lina Yao, Dalin Zhang, Xiaojun Chang, Guodong Long, Sen Wang
> This paper considers the distribution discrepancy between the labeled data and the unlabeled data, and align the feature distributions when the training data are distributed differently.

## Noise Robust SSL

- [Robust Semi-supervised Learning through Label Aggregation](http://iemppu.github.io/yan.pdf) (AAAI 2016) - Authors: Yan Yan, Zhongwen Xu, Ivor W. Tsang, Guodong Long, Yi Yang
> This paper considers the robustness of SSL algorithms when there exists label noise. The main idea is to adopt ensemble learning to aggregate multiple pseudo-labels.

## Adversarial Robust SSL

- [Robustness to Adversarial Perturbations in Learning from Incomplete Data](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/60ad83801910ec976590f69f638e0d6d-Paper.pdf) (NeurIPS 2019) - Authors: Amir Najaf, Shin-ichi Maeda, Masanori Koyama, Takeru Miyato
> This paper unifies Semi-Supervised Learning and Distributionally Robust Learning, and develops a generalization theory for the framework.

## Safe SSL

- [Scalable Semi-Supervised Aggregation of Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.05790.pdf) (NeurIPS 2015) - Authors: Akshay Balsubramani, Yoav Freund
> This paper presents an algorithm that learns to aggregate the predictions of an ensemble of binary classifiers. It has no assumptions about the structure or origin of the predictions or labels and the accuracy is guaranteed to be at least that of the best classifier in the ensemble.
- [Contrastive Pessimistic Likelihood Estimation for Semi-Supervised Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00269.pdf) (TPAMI 2016) - Authors: Marco Loog
> This paper proposes a general way to perform semisupervised parameter estimation for likelihood-based classifiers for which, on the fulltraining set, the estimates are never worse than the supervised solution in terms of the log-likelihood.
