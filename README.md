## Distribution Robust SSL

- [Distributionally Robust Semi-Supervised Learning for People-Centric Sensing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05299.pdf) (AAAI 2019) -  This paper considers the distribution discrepancy between the labeled data and the unlabeled data, and align the feature distributions when the training data are distributed differently.
- [Robustness to Adversarial Perturbations in Learning from Incomplete Data](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/60ad83801910ec976590f69f638e0d6d-Paper.pdf) (NeurIPS 2019) - This paper unifies Semi-Supervised Learning and Distributionally Robust Learning, and develops a generalization theory for the framework.

## Noise Robust SSL

- [Robust Semi-supervised Learning through Label Aggregation](http://iemppu.github.io/yan.pdf) (AAAI 2016) - This paper considers the robustness of SSL algorithms when there exists label noise. The main idea is to adopt ensemble learning to aggregate multiple pseudo-labels.
