## Distribution Robust SSL

- [Distributionally Robust Semi-Supervised Learning for People-Centric Sensing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05299.pdf) (AAAI 2019) -  This paper considers the distribution discrepancy between the labeled data and the unlabeled data, and align the feature distributions when the training data are distributed differently.
